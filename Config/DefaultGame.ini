Description=Blackfeather is a 2-player 3D platformer racing game made by an 8-person team (5 programmers and 3 artists) over a 5-month long period in Unity 5.The 1st player plays as a pirate, who is racing across platforming challenges to a treasure, while the 2nd player is a parrot attempting to slow down other pirate. The parrot slows down the pirate by activating various obstacles and traps littered throughout the path. Additionally, the parrot is also equipped with various objects that it can drop on the pirate to slow them down. After a short amount of time the players switch roles. Each time they swap roles their pirate will stay where they left off on the course. They will continue to swap roles until one of the pirates reaches the treasure at the end of the level. The goal is to be the first pirate to reach the treasure and to claim that gold for yourself!
